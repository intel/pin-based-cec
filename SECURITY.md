# Pin-Based Constant Execution Checker - Security Reporting Guidelines

Security issues discovered in Pin-Based Constant Execution Checker (Pin-Based CEC) should be reported directly to a current maintainer instead of creating a public issue. You will be contacted by a maintainer within 2 business days to acknowledge your report. You will be given status updates related to the fix. Final advisories will be posted in the repository under the [GitHub Security tab](https://github.com/intel/pin_based_cec/security).

Before contributing, please review and abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://01.org/blogs/2018/intel-covenant-code).
